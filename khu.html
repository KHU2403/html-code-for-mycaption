<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>The major liability or drawbacks of communication lines comes
because of the distortion of electrical lines or lack of generation
of electricity as like in remote areas or during disaster or natural
calamities. To set back such drawbacks, we need a renewable
source of energy which can function round the clock without
any disruption. Solar power bank is one of its kind. It works on
the power of the sun, converting solar to electrical and helps in
charging the cell phones which can be used in communication,
and thus, turns to be vital during disasters and power outage.</p>
<h2>components required </h2>
<ul>
<li>4V solar panel</li>
<li>battery 3.7V, 3000mah</li>
<li>USB circuit board,</li>
<li>LED's</li>
<li>diode</li>
<li>resistor</li>
<li>wires</li>
</ul>
<h2>methodology</h2>
<p>The motto of the project is to build a portable power bank which uses solar power as a source. We used affordable components to bring about a final product. Since it is a demo product we used components of low rating , but we could use better rated products for commercial use.  Here, we have one solar panel  of 
4V, for receiving the sunlight, which is connected to the battery 
of the system where the charge from the sun is stored for future 
use. The battery is of 3.7 V.Then, the battery is connected to the mobile charging 
circuit which is further connected to a USB port from where a 
mobile can be connected for charging.There are also LEDs attached at 
the solar panel side at the charging point for detection of flow 
of charge.  </p> 
<h2>cost estimation</h2>
<p>We made the product in such a way that it is economical.</p><ul>
<li>Solar panel rs150</li>
<li>Battery-we used an old drained battery</li>
<li>USB module rs160</li>
<li>resistor diode leds and wires rs50</li>
<li>other costs rs 100</li>
</ul><p>so the total cost estimation is approximately rs 500 ,but for a commercial power bank the cost could be made upto rs1000.</p>
<p>
<h2>conclusion</h2>
<p>Solar power banks are affordable, environment friendly, cost –
saving and reliable source of power supply for gadgets. The 
earth is already battling so many environmental hazards and 
global warming is the most glaring issue today. By using solar 
power, you will be conserving energy, thereby reducing the 
strain. This is because solar energy is pollution-free, it is clean, 
renewable energy. Its use doesn’t promote the emission of greenhouse gases, unlike regular electricity, instead, you are 
only tapping sunlight on mother earth. If you have a lot of 
electronic gadgets, the chances are that you normally pay high 
electricity bills. Well, that can changes when you go for a solar 
power bank. Since you will not be using the regular electricity 
as much, your utility bill will reduce. After all, you are not 
paying for sunlight. Most importantly, it helps stay connected 
anytime, anywhere and on the go!</p>
